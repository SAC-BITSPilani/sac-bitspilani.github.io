## In conversation with Vijay Varma.

###### Vijay Varma discusses his journey from doing MSc. Physics and B.E. Mechanical at BITS Pilani to pursuing his PhD in Physics at California Institute of Technology(Caltech) on Numerical Relativity and Gravitational Waves. He has worked at places like ICTS-TIFR and Raman Research Institute, Bangalore(RRI) for his thesis work and summer project respectively. Vijay shares his insights on embarking into undergraduate research and how to take that first step. He talks about the groundbreaking LIGO detections of Gravitational Waves as well as the scope of working in the field. The discussion on his research and his revelations on how things work at Caltech make for an interesting read!

**Hi Vijay!**

**What is your current line of work? How did you get into doing it?**

My work is mainly focussed on gravitational waves and numerical relativity. We can think of gravitational waves(GWs) as oscillations in the fabric of spacetime that propagate carrying the information about gravity. One of the most important sources of GWs is compact binary objects. These were the ones which were detected at the detection at LIGO. One of the goals of Numerical Relativity is to solve Einstein’s Equations numerically to predict the waveforms from these sources because even though we can solve Einstein’s equations analytically for a few particular cases, it’s really difficult to solve them for real astrophysical systems like two black holes orbiting each other. 
In order to solve Einstein’s equations, what you do is first set some initial conditions on an initial time slice. It’s sort of like solving an ODE, where you set some initial velocity and initial position. Then you solve Einstein’s Equations for the initial data on the time slice and you step forward in time using Einstein’s equations. I have been focussing on making improvements to the initial data part. 
The other stuff that I have been working on is estimating the accuracy of current waveform models and recently, constructing new waveform models for LIGO. LIGO detects GWs but it’s buried in a lot of noise. So you need very accurate waveform models to be able to detect them and estimate the source properties. I have been working on estimating what sort of errors we make in our current waveform models and I’m also trying to build an improved waveform model.

**It sounds really interesting! So which waveform models have you worked on? What kind of systems have you looked at?**

The ones LIGO has detected so far are binary black holes-  basically two black holes orbiting each other. We are also looking for waveforms from binary neutron stars, or a neutron star orbiting a black hole and a lot of other systems which we don’t know, but are out there. I’ve been mainly working on waveform models for binary black holes. But the current waveform models used by LIGO make a lot of assumptions, like they assume there’s no eccentricity in the system, i.e. the orbits are circular, which is a very reasonable assumption because eccentricity gets radiated away. They also assume that the main contribution in the system is from the quadrupolar part, which you can think of like the lowest harmonic of the waveform, the dominant part. I've been working on investigating the effects of the second assumption and identifying cases where it is not valid. I'm also working on a waveform model which is directly based on numerical relativity waveforms and which relaxes this assumption. Hopefully it will be a more accurate waveform model than the ones currently used by LIGO.

**Is it possible that using the assumptions that LIGO has made, the waveform models predicted by them could be wrong?**

It’s very unlikely that they would be wrong because they have also done studies investigating the validity of these assumptions. The systems detected so far have been ones in which both masses were close to being equal. In such cases, their assumptions hold pretty well. So it’s very, very unlikely that they’re wrong.

**As I recall, you have also done a project at ICTS, Bangalore. Can you tell us about your experience there?**

That’s where I did my final year thesis in which I spent one year at ICTS with Professor P. Ajith. That was sort of my second project on gravitational waves. I think I learned a lot working there. It was also my first exposure to spending a long time in a research environment and getting to know how things work. I got a glimpse of the research life.

**You mentioned that this was your second project on GWs. Which was the first?**

At the end of my third year, I did a project at Raman Research Institute, Bangalore with Prof. Bala Iyer. That was my first project and, at the time, I didn’t really know much about GWs or even that I really wanted to do research in physics. It actually gave me the confidence that I could do it and I have enjoyed doing it since then.

**We would like to know your views on the current research culture at BITS. 
What do you feel about the way research is being approached by undergrads here?**

As far as I know, we don’t have a lot of research going on; we have a very limited research culture. And I feel that we can improve a lot. There are a lot of people who want to do research but don’t know how to go about the whole process. They just don’t have the right guidance for getting into this sort of thing.

**Based on your experience, how do you think we can equip our campus to provide students with the right guidance?**

A lot of people in my batch including me felt that the most difficult step was trying to find that first project in which you can do some research. Also you always have this dilemma where you don’t have the experience to do an internship, but you don’t have an internship to gain the experience. So you’re always going around in circles. I think if BITS can appoint a faculty member in each department who is always available to students, he/she can help them find projects or internships and help them with the whole application process; it will be a great thing. Maybe we can set up a scholarship for a handful of people from BITS to go and do summer interns each year. It’s not too expensive and we can arrange it with institutes like TIFR and ICTS such that each year we send them a certain number of students and they give them some projects to do. That way there’ll be this connection between BITS and other research institutes too.

**Currently under the PS I system, every year some students are sent to certain research institutes like IUCAA, Pune and IISc, Bangalore for pursuing summer projects. However, within the BITS campus itself, there is very little scope for research in many fields. Can you suggest a way to overcome this, based on your experiences at the institutes you have been to?**

I think that’s mainly limited by the research interests of our faculty. We need more opportunities for the students to be able to do research. We can probably do that at BITS but it’s more of a long term thing to achieve. It will involve hiring specialised faculty and I don’t know how long it might take. In the meantime, we can have people go to other institutes. It doesn’t have to be outside India. Even in India we have a lot of great places.

**In your opinion, how does the general campus culture at Caltech differ from that at BITS Pilani?**

I think the undergrads are a lot more relaxed at BITS! We don’t have a lot of continuous assignments to do which is ‘great’ because you can be relaxed. At Caltech you have one homework per class they take, every week. But it’s not like they just focus on studying, they also have a lot of extra-curricular activities going on.


**How would you suggest undergraduates to pursue their studies and gain a strong foothold in research?**

I think the coursework is pretty important and sometimes in BITS we tend to ignore that. I think it’s okay to ignore parts of it but it’s important to do the coursework of whatever you are essentially interested in. Because if you don’t do that, you’ll end up having to redo all of it to actually understand it. One way to get into research is to do Study-Oriented Projects. That’s a great way to do a ‘research’ project. That will even get you a recommendation to try and find a better project or a more research oriented project. My advice would be to apply to as many places as possible when you are applying for internships. So the first time I applied, I had applied to a whole lot of places but I got into only one place. At that point I didn’t know if I really wanted to do that but I ended up deciding that let’s try this out and see if I like it. And I think that could be an important thing because you don’t know what’s good for you. A lot of people feel like ‘I want to do string theory and it’s a cool thing to do’. That’s good but you don’t know what actually string theory research is and you don’t know what the other fields are like until you explore them a bit. So my advice would be to apply to a lot of places and take up whatever you get for your first project. That is a great way to get started. Even if you don’t feel that it aligns perfectly with your interest, it will help you get whatever project you want the next time.

**What would be your two cents to the undergraduates out there who want to make it into research?**

From my experience, it’s a very enjoyable thing to do research. I feel like I’m doing what I would normally do as a hobby, but I get paid for it. It’s a very fun thing to do. And industry jobs are great but you should always keep an eye out for research. It can be a very fulfilling experience.

**When the first GW detection was made, you were at Caltech. How did it feel? How was the atmosphere at Caltech?**

At that time I wasn’t a part of the collaboration so it was still secret to me. But I sort of figured out from all the activity that was happening in the other groups. And yeah, it was really exciting! By the time they announced it, I was in the collaboration so I knew all about it. I wasn’t directly involved in dealing with the data but a lot of my friends were and talking to them I could find out before anyone else did. I was really glad that I was here.

**GW detection has opened a whole new window in astronomy. We were dependent on EM(Electromagnetic) waves till now. We also have new detectors like LIGO India coming up. What future do you see in GW Astronomy?**

Everything we know about the universe is being painted through EM observations but each time we started looking at a new wavelength of EM wave, we discovered a whole lot of new things which we had never expected. Like back in the mid 1900s, it was the first time we started looking at radio observations and we found out that there was so much more that was not visible solely by optical observations. We discovered pulsars, quasars and the Cosmic Microwave Background. I sort of hope that something similar can happen with GWs. We already found some detections from sources we expected but I think in the future there’ll be sources that we could never imagine and it will be a great thing to discover new things with GWs. And also GWs don’t interact strongly with matter so, for example, if there is a supernova, everything that happens at the core of the supernova, in the terms of EM interactions, is lost due to scattering before it reaches us. But since GWs don’t interact significantly with matter around it, we can get information directly from the core.
